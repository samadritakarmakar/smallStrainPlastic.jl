"""When working with plastic models it many times it becomes difficult to find the analytically jacobian
of a vector function. With denseJacobian we try to make that easy to do. It uses finite difference to do
this. Finite Differences are far from the best solution to find jacobians but are the easiest to
implement. Hence this solution.
